# Graduation Thesis

### Title: Chord Based Feature Extraction for Genre Classification in Popular Brazilian Music 

> Goal: extract music chords data and transform it 
to verify if harmonic structures are enough to 
predict music genre. 

  - Extraction of a big set of music chords via
  webscraping.
  - Resulting R package: `chorrrds`
    - 2000+ downloads on CRAN
    
  - Feature extraction (of the chords) for 
  creating more representative variables about the 
  songs. 
  - Use of the Spotify API for extracting more
  variables. 
  - Random forests for predicting the 
  music genre of each song.
